# 📌 Project Name: `serverless-cicd-stack`

## 📝 Project Description

This project is a fully serverless cloud-native application built on AWS, showcasing the integration of infrastructure as code, CI/CD automation, and scalable backend services.

It uses:
- **AWS Lambda** for running Python-based backend logic  
- **AWS Step Functions** to orchestrate workflows and connect services together  
- **Amazon DynamoDB** as a NoSQL database  
- **Amazon S3** for object storage  
- **Terraform** to provision and manage all cloud resources as infrastructure-as-code  
- **AWS Codepipeline** for a complete CI/CD pipeline that handles testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning
